# ProfanityFilter
This assignment was inspired by a report by the BBC about an “overzealous profanity checker’ on Virgin Media.  Your assignment is to produce a program using C++ which will read in a list of banned words from a file, as well  as an additional text file which will then be filtered using these banned words.
